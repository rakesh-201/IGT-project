## Getting Started

To use the package you will need to do a couple of things.

First, add the following scripts inside of your `HTML` head tag:

```
<script src="https://api.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/plugins/mapbox-gl-directions/v4.1.0/mapbox-gl-directions.js"></script>
<script src="https://api.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/plugins/mapbox-gl-geocoder/v4.7.0/mapbox-gl-geocoder.min.js"></script>
```

After this is done, go to mapbox.com and get a free account.

After your account is created, select the type of your application ( _Web/Android/iOS_ ). After this click on CDN and grab your access token.

And that's it...
